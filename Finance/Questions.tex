\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the loanable funds theory to explain what happens to international interest rates as China becomes a more significant world economy.  Remember that China saves a much larger proportion of its GDP than most other countries. 
\item How does a tax on consumption affect interest rates?
\item Considering two of the functions of money: means of transaction and store of value; what are the main factors affecting each of these types of demand? 
\item Use your answer to the previous question to sketch the factors that would be useful in a \emph{money-demand function}
\item What do \emph{open-market operations} seek to achieve. 
\item Use a supply-and-demand diagram to show how the market for inter-bank loans would respond to the weekend if the Bank of England were to refrain from taking any action. 
\item Using the ideas of the \emph{money multiplier} calculate the effect of a \textsterling 10 million increase in base money under the assumption that banks will lend as much as they can, that households and business are willing to borrow as much as is offered and the reserve requirement is 10\%.  How does this change if the reserve requirement is 20\%?  What does this tell you about the use of the reserve requirement to control monetary policy?
