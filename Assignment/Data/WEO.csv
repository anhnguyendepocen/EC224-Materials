United Kingdom,General government structural balance,National currency,Billions,"Source: National Statistical Office Latest actual data: 2013 Notes: General government variables exclude the effects of temporary effect of financial interventions. Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the U.K. Treasury's 2014 Budget, published in March 2014. However, on the revenue side, the authorities' projections are adjusted for differences between IMF staff forecasts of macroeconomic variables (such as GDP growth) and the forecasts of these variables assumed in the authorities' fiscal projections. In addition, IMF staff projections exclude the temporary effects of financial sector interventions and the effect on public sector net investment during 2012?13 of transferring assets from the Royal Mail Pension Plan to the public sector. Real government consumption and investment are part of the real GDP path, which, according to the IMF staff, may or may not be the same as projected by the U.K. Office for Budget Responsibility. Transfers of profits from the Bank of England's Asset Purchases Facility affect general government net interest payments. The timing of these payments can create differences between fiscal year primary balances published by the authorities and calendar year balances shown in the WEO.

United States,General government structural balance,National currency,Billions,"Source: BEA and IMF's Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (revenue, expenditure, and net lending); Flow of Funds (debt) Latest actual data: 2013 Notes: Revenue, expenditure, and net lending data are compiled according to the GFSM2001 methodology. Due to data limitations, most series begin 2001. Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the August 2014 Congressional Budget Office baseline adjusted for the IMF staff's policy and macroeconomic assumptions. The baseline incorporates the key provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, including a partial rollback of the sequester spending cuts in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. The rollback is fully offset by savings elsewhere in the budget. In fiscal years 2016 through 2021, the IMF staff assumes that the sequester cuts will continue to be partially replaced, in portions similar to those agreed upon under the Bipartisan Budget Act for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, with back-loaded measures generating savings in mandatory programs and additional revenues. Over the medium term, the IMF staff assumes that Congress will continue to make regular adjustments to Medicare payments (?DocFix?) and will extend certain traditional programs (such as the research and development tax credit). The fiscal projections are adjusted to reflect the IMF staff's forecasts of key macroeconomic and financial variables and different accounting treatment of financial sector support and of defined benefit pension plans and are converted to a general government basis. Historical data start at 2001 for most series because data compiled according to the 2001 Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM2001) may not be available for earlier years.
