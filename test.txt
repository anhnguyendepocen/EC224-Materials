The long-run growth rate of the economy is a function of the factors of
production and the ease and ability with which they can  be put together.  The
first of these will depend on the endowment (land and commodities that are
available), the growth of the working population (labour) and the increase in
the volume of machines and tools relative to the work that is applied
(capital). The second of these wil be related to the flexibility of the
syustem and the ease with which factors of production can be applied to their
most efficient use.  This, of course, depends on the mechanism that allocates
resources as well as the factors that ensure that this process runs smoothly. 

Each of these factors may attract some attention.  
\begin{itemize}
\item Changes in the overall workforce, due to immigration for example, would
increase the potential GDP
\item Changes in the composition of the workforce with a larger proportion of
working age increasing the potential about of economic activity that is
possible.
